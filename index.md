## About Me

<img class="profile-picture" src="shailja.jpg">

Hi! I am a software engineer at Flipkart. I graduated with a bachelors degree from the Department of Electrical Engineering, IIT Kharagpur in 2016.

## Research Interest

I am passionate about research on software engineering, algorithm and computational complexity. I am also interested in the applications of my work on computer vision and software engineering to robotics.


I was a Visiting Researcher at University of Washington (UW) in Computing and Software Systems Division under the guidance of Prof. Tyler Folsom for 3 months. I worked on [Localization and Navigation of a Self Driving Tricycle, Elcano](https://github.com/Sailja/elcano), an open source software which is written in C++. I developed the software for the following modules:
* Navigator: Reads data from GPS, speedometer, compass and optical mouse to get best position estimate.
* Vision: Developed and extended the vision system to be able to identify lane edges as an aid to staying in the lane.


For my bachelors thesis project I worked on [Visual navigation of mobile robot using monocular vision](https://github.com/Sailja/Visual-based-navigation) at IIT Kharagpur under the guidance of Prof. Jayanta Mukhopadhyay in the Department of Computer Science and Engineering. I presented methods to develop some of the building blocks for a personal assistant robot where I successfully developed novel approach of detecting obstacles using monocular vision.

Please refer to my resume for further details about all of my projects and research experience.
